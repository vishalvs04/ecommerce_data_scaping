# ecommerce_data_scaping
In this project, I used https://webscraper.io/test-sites/e-commerce/allinone as my source website, to scrap the data present on the site regarding the products.<br>
I used BeautifulSoup and Jupyter Notebook to perform this project, feel free to use, modify or copy the code and files as per your own requirement.<br>
